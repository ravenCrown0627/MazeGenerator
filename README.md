# Maze Generator

This project is designed to create a repository for randomly generating mazes and storing them in a container. The primary goal is to generate a maze where it is possible to navigate from one point to another.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: Generates a maze with random paths.
- **Multiple Representations**: Allows users to choose between:
  - **Adjacency Graph**: Represents the maze as a graph with nodes and edges.
  - **Adjacency List**: Represents the maze as a list of connections between nodes.

## Planned Outcomes

- A fully functional maze generator.
- Support for both adjacency graph and adjacency list representations.
- A containerized solution for storing and managing generated mazes.

## Usage

The maze generator will provide an interface for users to specify their preferred representation and generate a maze accordingly.
